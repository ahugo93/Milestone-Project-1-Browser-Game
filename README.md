HANGMAN GAME
# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Project Description

This will be a simple guessing game of hangman with alphabet buttons appear to guess the key word. A hint button will also appear for 3 hints per turn.

_(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)_

## Game Logic

```
Replace this text with pseudocode.
The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
    The player has 10 attempts with 1 hint per game at guessing the key word.
    The alphabet with be shown below guesses will remove letters.
    Player can also choose to click the hint button for a hint or play again to restart or try a different key word.
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
    if the player guesses a letter correct letters will come off board and nothing will appear on canvas
    if player guesses incorrectly a piece of the hangman will appear
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
    Player wins will display if player wins
    Player loses and hangman will appear of player loses 
    progress will show in canvas
```

## Deliverables

>Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
>*Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!*
>
> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.

    Keyboard must appear and letters function
- Another thing.

    hangman has to appear
- Etc.

    hint and try again buttons have to work 

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.

    letters have to disappear after selection

- Another that will be a stretch.

    remaining attemps display

- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
